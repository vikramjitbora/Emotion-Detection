# Emotion-Detection
Objective of this project is to detect emotions from images of faces as well as key facial points. We will be using two deep learning models to achieve this. The first model will predict the key points in the human face such as the location of lips, nose, eyes etc. The second model will analyze and detect the emotion in the face. We will also deploy this model using Tensorflow Serving
